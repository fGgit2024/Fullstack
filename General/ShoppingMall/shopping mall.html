                Louis Vuitton''s heritage as a trunk maker preceded even the
                founding of the company. It was in 1837 that a 16-year-old Louis
                Vuitton arrived in Paris by foot and started apprenticing for
                Monsieur Maréchal. At the time, horse-drawn carriages, boats and
                trains were the main modes of transportation, and baggage was
                handled roughly. Travelers called upon craftsmen to pack and
                protect their individual objects. Louis Vuitton quickly became a
                valued craftsman at the Parisian atelier of Monsieur Maréchal.
                These were the roots of his highly specialized trade; the
                beginnings of his career in an artisanal industry that called
                upon skills to custom design boxes and, later, trunks according
                to clients' wishes. Louis Vuitton stayed for 17 years before
                opening his own workshop at 4 Rue Neuve-des-Capucines near the
                Place Vendome.
